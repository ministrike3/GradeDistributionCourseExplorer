## Current Status

**Original Data Source:** FOIA requested data from Fall 2015 that lists all sections of all courses on campus and their grade distributions 

**Python**:Take the Fall15.csv file and strip out all class sections that don't give out actual grades (Discussions, Labs, recitals, lessons, etc.). Generate an output csv file with only data I actually care about, and an HTML file that stores everything in a basic, 1300 row, 4 column table. 

**HTML/CSS/JQUERY:** The final step is using a jQuery plugin called tablesorter that allowed me to turn my static HTML table into one that was sortable. A CSS style sheet completed the (albeit basic) look to allow for full functionality. The site is now hosted on my personal space at the University of Illinois.


##Future Features

So, I'd like to create a nav bar that lets to sort by either Gen-Ed requirement or by subject. 

Click on class and see grade distributions by professor. 

Combine data from multiple semesters rather then just the one included rn

Hit the UIUC course API to get the credit hours of courses so i can filter out 0/1/2 CH courses that are either major restricted or otherwise not useful for the general population
