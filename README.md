## Current Status

**Original Data Source:** FOIA requested data from Fall 2015 that lists all sections of all courses on campus and their grade distributions 

**Python:**Take the Fall15.csv file and strip out all class sections that don't give out actual grades (Discussions, Labs, recitals, lessons, etc.). Generate an output csv file with only data I actually care about, and an HTML file that stores everything in a basic, 1300 row, 4 column table.

**HTML/CSS/JQUERY:** The final step is using a jQuery plugin called tablesorter that allowed me to turn my static HTML table into one that was sortable. A CSS style sheet completed the (albeit basic) look to allow for full functionality. The site is now hosted on my personal space at the University of Illinois.


##Future Features

Create a Searchbar to look for specific classes

Click on class and see grade distributions by professor. 

**NEXT IN LINE THIS IS IMPORTANT** Combine data from multiple semesters rather then just the one included rn
